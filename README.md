# VampireVillage
RTS Unity game created for a university group project

Setting up and managing a colony of vampires is a hard thing to do. You are Dracula who is sick and tired of living in the shadows so you’ve decided to create the first vampire village. Night is your only safe time and everything sees you as a threat, especially those pesky humans. 

Help Dracula in commanding units, gathering resources as well as expanding/upgrading and defending his colony’s one and only safe haven in Vampire Village, a 3D strategy, survival game.
